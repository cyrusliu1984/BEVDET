# BEVDET
A modified BEVDet version enabling direct ROS topic reading and pipeline-based data processing.

### Integration Guide
This modified version enables direct ROS topic reading and pipeline-based data processing for the original BEVDet project. To use this feature:

1. **Original BEVDet Repository**: The base project is available at [https://github.com/HuangJunJie2017/BEVDet](https://github.com/HuangJunJie2017/BEVDet)
2. **Replacement Step**: Replace the `tools` directory in the original BEVDet project with the `tools` directory provided in this repository.
3. **Project Documentation**: For detailed technical specifications, usage instructions, and system design, refer to the full documentation at [https://vxbi5bwchzd.feishu.cn/wiki/IaL0wjVoKiyQ1RkZBo5cOmZkn7r](https://vxbi5bwchzd.feishu.cn/wiki/IaL0wjVoKiyQ1RkZBo5cOmZkn7r)

> Note: Ensure the base environment of the original BEVDet project (dependencies, dataset configurations, etc.) is properly set up before integration. Refer to the original BEVDet README for basic installation and data preparation guidelines.
